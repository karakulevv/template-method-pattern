# Template Method Pattern Example: Automobile Assembly Line

## Introduction

The Template Method Pattern provides a template algorithm (represented by the AutomobileAssemblyLine) defining a series of steps for assembling automobiles. It allows subclasses (SedanAssemblyLine, SUVAssemblyLine, etc.) to provide customized implementations for specific steps while adhering to the overall structure of the assembly line.

## Real-world Analogy

In the context of automobile manufacturing, the Template Method Pattern mirrors the standardized procedures of an assembly line. It serves as the blueprint for creating different types of vehicles (sedans, SUVs, trucks) while enabling individual assembly lines to tailor specific steps according to the requirements of each vehicle type.

## Components

### Abstract Class (AutomobileAssemblyLine)

- Defines the template method `ManufactureCar()` encapsulating the sequence of steps for assembling a car.
- Contains abstract methods representing specific assembly steps.

### Concrete Classes (SedanAssemblyLine, SUVAssemblyLine, etc.)

- Extend the abstract class (AutomobileAssemblyLine).
- Implement specific methods for assembling different types of vehicles.
  
## Usage

1. Instantiate concrete assembly line objects for different vehicle types (e.g., SedanAssemblyLine, SUVAssemblyLine).
2. Call the `ManufactureCar()` method on each assembly line to assemble respective vehicles.

## Implementation Notes

- Add more concrete classes representing various vehicle types to extend the assembly line.
- Ensure each assembly line conforms to the template structure while customizing specific steps as needed.
